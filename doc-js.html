            JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.</li>
        <li>ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. <br/>It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. <br/>The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
        
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.<br/> It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, ECMAScript itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.</p>
